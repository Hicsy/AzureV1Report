# AzureV1Report
A hacky Azure V1 module used to scrape O365 user info.

## About
This is an example of what I wrote as a Proof-Of-Concept to scrape Office 365 user info from a tenancy which we didn't have an administrator login.
It wasn't approved for development due to team constraints, so instead I added in a controller (one-click "gui" text functions for junior staff) and we put it straight into production anyway.

This script of mine is a couple years old, and I also stripped it out from the original module and anonymised it, so it wouldn't work any more but it still provides a frozen-in-time typical example of my typical work in the field.

With more time, I would like to have made separate controller scripts, and also divided out the advanced properties so they aren't holding up the main process.
